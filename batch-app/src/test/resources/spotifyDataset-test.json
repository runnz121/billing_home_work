What about you?\" She said, \"I don't care ... if you're hungry, let's eat.\" I said, \"That's what we're gonna do! But first you gotta tell me What it is you're hungry for!\" And she says, \"Let me think... What's left in our refrigerator?\" I said, \"Well, there's tuna, I know.\" She said, \"That went bad a week ago!\" I said, \"Is the chili okay?\" She said, \"You finished that yesterday!\" I hopped up and said \"I don't know; do you want to get something delivered?\" She's like, \"Why would I want to eat liver? I don't even like liver!\" I'm like, \"No, I said 'delivered.'\" She's like, \"I heard you say 'liver'!\" I'm like, \"I should know what I said...\" She's like, \"Whatever! I just don't want any liver!\" Well, I was gonna say something But my cell phone started to ring Now who could be callin' me? Well I checked my caller ID It was just cousin Larry Callin' for the third time today... My wife said, \"Let it go to voicemail.\" I said, \"Okay.\" \"Where were we? Oh, dinner, right! So what d'ya want to do?\" She said, \"Why don't you whip up somethin' in the kitchen?\" \"Yeah,\" I said, \"why don't you?\" And then she said \"Baby, can't we just go out to dinner, please?\" I say, \"No\" She says, \"Yes\" I say, \"No\" She says, \"Yes\" I say, \"No\" She says, \"Yes... Oh, here's your keys\" I step a little bit closer Say, \"Okay, where ya want to go?\" She says, \"How about The Ivy?\" I said, \"Yeah, well, I don't know... I don't feel like gettin all dressed up And eatin' expensive food\" She's says, \"Olive Garden?\" I say, \"Nah, I'm not in the mood... And Burrito King would make me gassy There's no doubt\" She says, \"Just forget about it\" I said, \"No, I swear I'm gonna take you out!\" Then I get an idea I say, \"I know what we'll do!\" She says, \"What?\" I say, \"Guess!\" She says \"What?\" I say, \"We're goin' to the drive-thru!\" So we head out the front door Open the garage door Then I open the car doors And we get in those car doors Put my key in the ignition And then I turn it sideways Then we fasten our seat belts As we pull out the driveway Then we drive to the drive-thru Heading off to the drive-thru We're approaching the drive-thru Getting close to the drive-thru! Almost there at the drive-thru Now we're here at the drive thru Here in line at the drive-thru Did I mention the drive-thru? [Verse 2] Well, here we are In the drive-thru line, me and her Cars in front of us, cars in back of us All just waiting to order There's some idiot in a Volvo With his brights on behind me I lean out the window and scream \"Hey! What you trying to do, blind me?\" My wife says \"Maybe we should park... We could just go eat inside.\" I said, \"I'm wearin' bunny slippers So I ain't leavin' this ride...\" Now a woman on a speaker box Is sayin', \"Can I take your order, please?\" I said, \"Yes indeed, you certainly can We'd like two hamburgers with onions and cheese.\" Then my wife says \"Baby, hold on—I've changed my mind! I think I'm gonna have a chicken sandwich instead this time\" I said, \"You always get a cheeseburger!\" She says, \"That's not what I'm hungry for.\" I put my head in my hands and scream \"I don't know who you are anymore!\" The voice on the speaker says \"I don't have all day!\" I said, \"Then take our order And we'll be on our way! I wanna get a chicken sandwich And I want a cheeseburger, too\" She's like, \"You want onions on that?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, I already said that I do... Plus we need curly fries And don't you dare forget it! And two medium root beers No, just one—we'll split it.\" Then I said \"I'm guessin' that You're probably not too bright... So read me back my order Let's make sure you got it right.\" She says \"One—you want a chicken sandwich Two—you want a cheeseburger Three—curly fries, and a large root beer\" \"Stop! Don't go no further!\" \"I never ordered a large root beer I said medium, not large!\" Then she says \"We're havin' a special I supersized you at no charge.\" \"Oh.\" And that's all I could say, was \"Oh.\" And she says \"Now there is somethin' else That I really think you should know You can have unlimited refills For just a quarter more...\" I say \"Great, except we're in the drive-thru... So what would I want that for?\" Then she says \"Wait a minute Your voice sounds so familiar ... hey, is this Paul? And my wife is all like \"No, that ain't Paul Now tell me, who's this Paul?\" She says \"Oh, he's just some guy Who goes to school with me I sat behind him last year And I copied off of him in Geometry\" I said, \"I know a guy named Paul He used to be my plumber He was prematurely bald And he moved to Pittsburgh last summer He also had bladder problems And a really bad infection on his toe.\" And she says, \"Mister, please, you can stop right there That's way more than I needed to know!\" And then we both were quiet And things got real intense Then she says \"Next window, please That'll be five dollars and eighty two cents!\" So we inched ahead in line Movin' painfully slow I got a little bored So I turned on the radio... [Black Dog by Led Zeppelin] Click, turned it off Because my wife was getting a headache So we both just sat there quietly for her sake Then I looked at her And she looked back at me And I said \"Um I think you have somethin' in your teeth.\" She turned away from me And then turned back and said \"Did I get it?\" I said \"Yeah. Well, I mean, most of it... But hey, ya know, don't sweat it.\" Then she said \"How about now?\" I said \"Yeah, almost There's still a little bit there, but don't worry It's probably just a piece of toast.\" Now we're at the pay window Or whatever you call it Put my hand in my pocket I can't believe there's no wallet! [Verse 3] And the lady at the window's like \"Well, well, well, that'll be five eighty-two\" I turn around to my wife and say \"How much have you got on you?\" She just rolls her eyes and says \"I'll pay for this, I guess\" So she reaches into her purse And busts out the American Express I hand it to the lady And she says \"Oh, dear It's gotta be cash only We don't take credit cards here\" I took back the card and said \"Gee, really? Well, that sucks\" And that's when I found out My wife was only carryin' three bucks I said, \"I thought you were gonna hit the ATM today\" She says, \"I never got around to it, so where's your wallet anyway?\" And I said, \"Never mind Just help me to find some change...\" Now the lady at the window Is lookin' at me kind of strange... And she says, \"Mister, please We gotta move this line along\" I said, \"Now, hold your stinkin' horses, lady! We won't be long\" So I looked around inside the glove-box And checked the mat beneath my feet I found a nickel in an ashtray And a couple pennies and a dime in the space between the seats Before long I had a little pile Of coins of every sort The lady counts it up and says \"You're still about a dollar short\" And now my woman's got this weird look Frozen on her face She screams, \"You know I wasn't even really hungry in the first place!\" And so I turned around To the cashier again I shrugged and said, \"Okay Forget the chicken sandwich then\" So I pick up my change Pick up my receipt And I drive to the pickup window Man, I just can't wait to eat And now we see this acne-ridden Kid about sixteen Wearin' a dorky nametag that says \"Hello, my name is Eugene\" And he hands me a paper bag I look him in the eyes And I say to him, \"Hey, Eugene Could I get some ketchup for my fries?\" Well, he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him And he says, \"I'm sorry! What did you want again?\" I say \"Ketchup!\" And he says, \"Oh, yeah, that's right... I just spaced out there for a second I'm really kind of burnt tonight.\" And then he hands me the ketchup And now we're finally drivin' away And the food is drivin' me mad With its intoxicating bouquet I'm starvin' to death By the time we pull up at the traffic light I say \"Baby, gimme that burger I just gotta have a bite!\" So she reaches in the bag And pulls out the burger And she hands me the burger And I pick up the burger And then I unwrap the paper I bite into those buns And I just can't believe it They forgot the onions!","Length":"10:50","emotion":"sadness","Genre":"rock,pop,comedy","Album":"Straight Outta Lynwood","Release Date":"2006-09-26","Key":"E Maj","Tempo":0.4556213018,"Loudness (db)":0.6437136628,"Time signature":"4\/4","Explicit":"No","Popularity":"37","Energy":"34","Danceability":"80","Positiveness":"69","Speechiness":"8","Liveness":"29","Acousticness":"60","Instrumentalness":"0","Good for Party":0,"Good for Work\/Study":1,"Good for Relaxation\/Meditation":0,"Good for Exercise":0,"Good for Running":0,"Good for Yoga\/Stretching":0,"Good for Driving":0,"Good for Social Gatherings":0,"Good for Morning Routine":0,"Similar Songs":[{"Similar Artist 1":"Original Broadway Cast of Into the Woods","Similar Song 1":"Prologue: Into the Woods","Similarity Score":0.9383149136},{"Similar Artist 2":"Original Broadway Cast of Into the Woods","Similar Song 2":"Our Little World","Similarity Score":0.9383149136},{"Similar Artist 3":"Roger","Similar Song 3":"I Heard It Through the Grapevine","Similarity Score":0.9337967457}]}

I'm only asking, cause your nose looks slightly better Than the rest of your face\" I arched my eyebrow, ever so slightly Which was my way of asking \"Do you want my old Hewlett-Packard printer? It still works, Kinda And I got a bunch of ink cartridges left\" Then, she let out a long sigh Which, I took to mean, \"Uh Mama, What is that deodorant you're wearing? It's intoxicating Why don't we drive out to the country sometime? And collect deer ticks in a zip-lock baggie\", Oh yeah I gave her a penetrating stare Which could only mean \"You are my answer, my answer to everything Which is why, I'll probably do very poorly On the written part of my driver's test\" [Chorus] Yes, It all happened On the Jackson Park Express On the Jackson Park Express On the Jackson Park Express On the Jackson Park Express [Verse 2] I knew she was starting to fall for me Cause she crinkled her nose, which unmistakably meant \"Baby, lets wear each other's clothes And speak in a thick German accent And, maybe someday we can own and operate Our own mobile pet-grooming service\" I couldn't hold back my feelings I gave her a look, that said \"I would make any sacrifice for your love Goat, chicken, whatever I could never hold you close enough Let's have our bodies surgically grafted together Oh, surgically grafted together\" She picked up her newspaper, and started reading to herself Which I'm sure, was a way of telling me \"When you're cold, I will warm you When you're shivering, I will hold you When you're nauseous, I will give you Pepto-Bismol every hour For as long as the symptoms persist Oh, I, I never, ever want to see you cry So, please let me cauterize your tear ducts with an arc welder\" Then, I glanced down, at her shirt, for a second In a way that clearly implied \"I like your boobs\" [Chorus] [Verse 3] I cleared my throat quietly, and then, I looked away And I'm sure it was obvious to her, just what I was trying to say I was trying to say, \"Hey I'd like to make a wall-sized mural out of all the dead skin cells That you slough off while you sleep at night\" Whoa-o-Oh, \"I'd like to rip you wide open And french-kiss every single one of your internal organs Oh, I'd like to remove all your skin, and wear your skin, over my own skin But not in a creepy way\" Then, I'm pretty sure, she looked at me, out of the corner of her good eye And, though, she never spoke a word, this is exactly what I heard She was saying, \"Oh! I wanna make out with you, in an abandoned toll-booth, in the middle of a monsoon I wanna ride dolphins with you, in the moonlight Until the staff at Sea World kicks us out I want you inside me, oh, like a tapeworm\" I pointed to the side of my mouth, as a way of indicating \"Hey, I think you got something on the side of your mouth\" She licked the corner of her lips, as if to say \"Here?\", I nodded, implying, \"Yeah, you got it\" And, then the bus stopped, at 53rd Street, and she got up suddenly \"Where are you going?\", pleaded my eyes, \"Baby, don't you do this to me Think of the beautiful children we could have someday We could school them at home, Raise them up the right way And protect them from the evils of the world Like Trigonometry and Prime Numbers, oh no Baby, please don't go\" She brushed my leg, as she left the bus I'm sure that was her way of saying \"I'm sorry this just isn't working out You're suffocating me I need some space to find out what life's all about So, goodbye forever, my love\" And deep inside, I knew she was right It was time for us both to move on And though, I never got her number, oh no no She never bothered to leave her address, oh But, as long as I live, I'll never forget Those precious moments we shared together [Outro] On the Jackson Park Express On the Jackson Park Express On the Jackson Park Express On the Jackson Park Express On the Jackson Park Express On the Jackson Park Express On the Jackson Park Express On the Jackson Park Express","Length":"09:05","emotion":"joy","Genre":"rock,pop,comedy","Album":"Mandatory Fun","Release Date":"2014-07-15","Key":"G Maj","Tempo":0.6568047337,"Loudness (db)":0.7296511628,"Time signature":"4\/4","Explicit":"No","Popularity":"24","Energy":"48","Danceability":"41","Positiveness":"51","Speechiness":"3","Liveness":"6","Acousticness":"34","Instrumentalness":"0","Good for Party":0,"Good for Work\/Study":0,"Good for Relaxation\/Meditation":0,"Good for Exercise":0,"Good for Running":0,"Good for Yoga\/Stretching":0,"Good for Driving":0,"Good for Social Gatherings":0,"Good for Morning Routine":0,"Similar Songs":[{"Similar Artist 1":"Lightspeed Champion","Similar Song 1":"Midnight Surprise","Similarity Score":0.9845223445},{"Similar Artist 2":"Housefires,Nate Moore","Similar Song 2":"Coming Home Live","Similarity Score":0.9724470521},{"Similar Artist 3":"Maverick City Music,Naomi Raine,Maryanne J.
